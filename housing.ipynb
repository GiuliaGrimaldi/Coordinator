    "# EDA - HOUSING PRICING DATASET\n",
    "In this notebook we perform a Explorative Data Analisis of the data of the housing.csv dataset.\n",
    "The dataset contains 545 observation (houses) and 13 variables.\n",
    "- price: price of the house;\n",
    "- area: area of the house (m^2);\n",
    "- bedrooms: number of house bedroom's;\n",
    "- bathrooms: number/if batrooms;\n",
    "- storeis: number of house storeis (storey meaning any level part of a building with a floor that could be used by people;\n",
    "- mainroad: Weather connected to Main Road;\n",
    "- guestroom: Weather has a guest room;\n",
    "- basement: Weather has a basement;\n",
    "- hotwaterheating: Weather has a hotwater heater;\n",
    "- airconditioning: Weather has an airconditioning;\n",
    "- parking: number/if parking in the house;\n",
    "- prefarea: if the House is or not in a preferable are of the town;\n",
    "- furnishingstatus: Furnishing status of the House.\n",

    "### OBJECTIVE\n",
    "The objective of the analisys is to import, clean and prepare the data for a regression problem.\n",
    "In this operation keep in mind that u should deal with null values (choose weather to drop them or fill them and with what),\n",
    "also for the regression problem we can not have categorical variables therefore we need some kind of encoding for the variables that are not numeric.\n",
    "Try to get the most out of the this dataset studying how the variables are correlated wqith each other and which are the variables that most influence the price outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ONLY A DEMO OF WHAT WE CAN PERFORM IN AN EDA AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE ANALISYS. USE THIS AS A GUIDE OR INSPIRATION FOR YOUR OWN ANALISYS AND DO NOT JUST COPY AND PASTE THE CODE BUT TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY."
